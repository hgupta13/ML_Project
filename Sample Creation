We are using the data from Romero, Mauricio; Sandefur, Justin; Sandholtz, Wayne, 2018,
"Partnership Schools for Liberia", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5OPIYU, Harvard Dataverse, V4.

The data was used for the paper "Outsourcing Education: Experimental Evidence from Liberia" by the same set of authors.

In our project we use the publically available data provided by the authors. The entire dataset is available at the above link 
and is also available on Google Drive.

For the purposes of this project, we use the cleaned "sample.csv" file. The "sample.csv" is created using "sample_creation.R" code.
