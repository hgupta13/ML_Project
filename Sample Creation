#We are using the data from Romero, Mauricio; Sandefur, Justin; Sandholtz, Wayne, 2018,
#"Partnership Schools for Liberia", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/5OPIYU, Harvard Dataverse, V4.

#The data was used for the paper "Outsourcing Education: Experimental Evidence from Liberia" by the same set of authors.

#In our project we use the publically available data provided by the authors. The entire dataset is available at the above link 
#and is also available on Google Drive.

#The code for creating the sample.csv file is described below

#Import necessary packages
library(haven)
library(dplyr)


#Import raw data from the publically available data
#This data has been preprocessed
#See "Readme.pdf" for details

#Baseline data for student controls
Student_baseline <-read_dta("~/PSL Endline Dataverse Files/Analysis/usedata_public/baseline/Student.dta")

#Endline data for student outcomes

#school characterisitcs
school <-  read_dta("~/PSL Endline Dataverse Files/Analysis/usedata_public/SchoolControls.dta")

#We select the relevant student and school controls
# The controls are the ones described in Table A.5 of the online appendix of the paper

#Student Controls
Student_baseline = Student_baseline %>%

#School level controls
school = school %>% 
  select(schoolid_nopii,groupid_nopii,Average2015,FacilitiesIndex,Rural, TimeToBank,
         treatment, turnedpsl)


#We choose the outcome data from the tests conducted at the end of the school year
#Outcome data
outcomes = Student_endline %>% select(uniqueid_nopii,schoolid_nopii,
